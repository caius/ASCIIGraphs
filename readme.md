# ASCIIGraphs

ASCII Graphs. Need I say more?

Born out of a bored campfire conversation and a quick google turning up not much in the way of existing ASCII graph libraries for ruby.

So far only the ProgressBar generator exists, which just generates you a little progress bar like this:

	|-----x----------|

See `examples/` for usage of it, and `lib/ascii_graphs/progress_bar.rb` for the code behind it.

Fork away and add your own generators!
